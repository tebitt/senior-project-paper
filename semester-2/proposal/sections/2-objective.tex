\section{Objective}

\subsection{Main Objective Statement}
The primary objective of the project’s second phase is to continue the design, development, and deployment of an emotional wellness robot capable of recognizing and responding to stress and anxiety symptoms in users aged 18 and older through the integration of AI technologies such as computer vision and speech emotion recognition. In particular, this phase focuses on finishing a minimum viable product that can be appropriately tested on multiple end users in a controlled environment.

\subsection{Specific Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully 3D print the robotic outer shell following the design concept and specifications accomplished in the first semester.
    \item Integrate input processing, model serving, and actuator outputs into the board Jetson Nano.
    \item Develop 15 action bubbles (set of interactions given a certain input) for the robot. In other words, the robot will have 15 different sets of interactions.
    \item Conduct a 2-week testing period in a live environment to test the robot’s effectiveness in identifying and improving positivity and anxiety.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurable Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given the testing sample size, the team hopes to achieve more than a 50\% improvement in before–and–after positive well-being and anxiety ratings, indicated by the questionnaire.
    \item Achieve a sample size of more than 50 recipients.
\end{itemize}
