	abstract = {Escalating global mental health demand exceeds existing clinical capacity. Scalable digital solutions will be essential to expand access to high-quality mental healthcare. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a digital intervention to alleviate mild, moderate and severe symptoms of generalized anxiety. This structured, evidence-based program combined an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven conversational agent to deliver content with human clinical oversight and user support to maximize engagement and effectiveness. The digital intervention was compared to three propensity-matched real-world patient comparator groups: i) waiting control; ii) face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and iii) remote typed-CBT. Endpoints for effectiveness, engagement, acceptability, and safety were collected before, during and after the intervention, and at one-month follow-up. Participants (n=299) used the program for a median of 6 hours over 53 days. There was a large clinically meaningful reduction in anxiety symptoms for the intervention group (per-protocol (n=169): change on GAD-7 = -7.4, d = 1.6; intention-to-treat (n=299): change on GAD-7 = -5.4, d = 1.1) that was statistically superior to the waiting control, non-inferior to human-delivered care, and was sustained at one-month follow-up. By combining AI and human support, the digital intervention achieved clinical outcomes comparable to human-delivered care while significantly reducing the required clinician time. These findings highlight the immense potential of technology to scale effective evidence-based mental healthcare, address unmet need, and ultimately impact quality of life and economic burden globally.Competing Interest StatementChief Investigator (EMa) and other investigators (CEP, EMi, GW, MPE, EC, SL, AS, CH, JY, MB, LM, SM, RC, VT, AC, AW, AB) are employees of ieso Digital Health Limited (the company funding this research) or its subsidiaries.

abstract = {Background
Loneliness and social isolation are well-known factors that worsen the symptoms among patients with mental disorders. Few previous studies have explored loneliness and social isolation among populations with mental disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, our study examined the mental health impact of the pandemic on these population groups in terms of loneliness and social isolation.
Methods
We used data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Surveys, a large-scale online survey. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we calculated the odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of moderate-to-severe loneliness and high social isolation for major chronic diseases, including mental disorders, after adjusting for potential confounders. Calculations were performed for each type of mental disorder. Finally, calculations were performed to explore the association between moderate-to-severe loneliness or high social isolation and psychiatric symptoms among patients with mental disorders.
Results
Of the 28,175 participants, 2021 (7.2 %) had a mental disorder. Mental disorders, especially depression and anxiety disorders, were found to be associated with a higher risk of moderate-to-severe loneliness and high social isolation. Patients with mental disorders who experienced moderate-to-severe loneliness and high social isolation were found to have exacerbated psychiatric symptoms.
Limitation
Our findings were obtained from a cross-sectional study design.
Conclusions
Patients with mental disorders were more vulnerable to moderate-to-severe loneliness and high social isolation during the pandemic, which contributed to the exacerbation of their symptoms. Depression and anxiety, in particular, were most likely to occur and required special attention.}

abstract = {Both physical appearance and voice can elicit mental images of what someone and/or something should sound and look like. This is particularly relevant for human-robot interaction design and research since any voice can be added to a robot. Therefore, it is important to give robots voices that match users’ expectations. In this paper, we examined the voice-appearance association by asking participants to match a robot image with a voice (Experiment 1, N = 24), and vice versa, a voice with a robot image (Experiment 2, N = 24), in two mixed-methods studies. We looked at participants’ differences that could influence the voice-robot association (gender and nationality) and at voice and robot features that could influence participants’ voice preferences (voice gender, pitch and robot’s appearance). Results show that nationality influenced participants’ association with a robot image after hearing its voice. Furthermore, a content analysis identified that when creating a voice mental image, participants looked at robots’ gendered characteristics and height and they paid special attention to human-like and gender-specific cues in a voice when forming a mental image of a robot. Sociological differences also emerged, with Swedish participants suggesting the use of gender-neutral voices to avoid strengthening existing stereotypes, and Italians saying the opposite. Our work highlights the importance of individual differences in the robot voice-appearance association and the importance of involving the end user in designing the voice.},

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience (UX) has become paramount. This study delves into the intricate realm of web interaction design, aiming to enhance user satisfaction and engagement. Through the integration of emotion recognition and eye-tracking technologies, a profound relationship between user emotions and web interface design is unveiled. The central theme of this research revolves around the integration of emotion recognition and eye-tracking technologies to evaluate web interaction designs. An experimental study involving 24 participants from diverse backgrounds and age groups was conducted. These participants navigated web interfaces that featured both emotion recognition and eye-tracking technologies. Three distinct tasks were carefully crafted to represent a spectrum of web interactions, ranging from basic navigation to complex decision-making. Data collection involved real-time valence and arousal scores, video recordings, visual attention patterns, task completion times, and questionnaires. The analysis revealed a series of significant discoveries. Users who engaged with simplified web versions consistently exhibited elevated valence values, indicative of heightened positive emotional feedback, diverging starkly from their counterparts navigating complex web iterations. The dynamic ebb and flow of emotional states, underscored by arousal levels, underscore the pivotal role of real-time emotional assessment in the critical evaluation of web interfaces. Moreover, the study unveiled a persistent preference for a state of emotional calmness during interactions, demonstrating a universal need for user-centered design principles that prioritize minimal cognitive load and emotional tranquility. In summation, this research contributes a robust framework to the design community and academia for the comprehensive evaluation of web interaction designs. The findings underscore the paramount significance of simplicity, real-time emotional evaluation, and unwavering adherence to user-centered design principles in the realm of web interaction. This study constitutes an invaluable repository for designers, developers, and researchers, steering their endeavors towards the relentless pursuit of optimized user experiences within the ever-evolving digital landscape.

abstract = {Summary
Objective
This study examines the acoustic correlates of the vocal expression of emotions in contemporary commercial music (CCM) and classical styles of singing. This information may be useful in improving the training of interpretation in singing.
Study Design
This is an experimental comparative study.
Methods
Eleven female singers with a minimum of 3 years of professional-level singing training in CCM, classical, or both styles participated. They sang the vowel [ɑ:] at three pitches (A3 220Hz, E4 330Hz, and A4 440Hz) expressing anger, sadness, joy, tenderness, and a neutral voice. Vowel samples were analyzed for fundamental frequency (fo) formant frequencies (F1-F5), sound pressure level (SPL), spectral structure (alpha ratio = SPL 1500-5000 Hz—SPL 50-1500 Hz), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), perturbation (jitter, shimmer), onset and offset duration, sustain time, rate and extent of fo variation in vibrato, and rate and extent of amplitude vibrato.
Results
The parameters that were statistically significantly (RM-ANOVA, P ≤ 0.05) related to emotion expression in both genres were SPL, alpha ratio, F1, and HNR. Additionally, for CCM, significance was found in sustain time, jitter, shimmer, F2, and F4. When fo and SPL were set as covariates in the variance analysis, jitter, HNR, and F4 did not show pure dependence on expression. The alpha ratio, F1, F2, shimmer apq5, amplitude vibrato rate, and sustain time of vocalizations had emotion-related variation also independent of fo and SPL in the CCM style, while these parameters were related to fo and SPL in the classical style.
Conclusions
The results differed somewhat for the CCM and classical styles. The alpha ratio showed less variation in the classical style, most likely reflecting the demand for a more stable voice source quality. The alpha ratio, F1, F2, shimmer, amplitude vibrato rate, and the sustain time of the vocalizations were related to fo and SPL control in the classical style. The only common independent sound parameter indicating emotional expression for both styles was SPL. The CCM style offers more freedom for expression-related changes in voice quality.}

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the main types of neural networks used for image recognition and classification. CNNs have several uses, some of which are object recognition, image processing, computer vision, and face recognition. Input for convolutional neural networks is provided through images. Convolutional neural networks are used to automatically learn a hierarchy of features that can then be utilized for classification, as opposed to manually creating features. In achieving this, a hierarchy of feature maps is constructed by iteratively convolving the input image with learned filters. Because of the hierarchical method, higher layers can learn more intricate features that are also distortion and translation invariant. The main goals of this study are to help academics understand where there are research gaps and to talk in-depth about CNN’s building blocks, their roles, and other vital issues.},

  abstract = {Many researchers have been seeking robust emotion recognition system for already last two decades. It would advance computer systems to a new level of interaction, providing much more natural feedback during human–computer interaction due to analysis of user affect state. However, one of the key problems in this domain is a lack of generalization ability: we observe dramatic degradation of model performance when it was trained on one corpus and evaluated on another one. Although some studies were done in this direction, visual modality still remains under-investigated. Therefore, we introduce the visual cross-corpus study conducted with the utilization of eight corpora, which differ in recording conditions, participants’ appearance characteristics, and complexity of data processing. We propose a visual-based end-to-end emotion recognition framework, which consists of the robust pre-trained backbone model and temporal sub-system in order to model temporal dependencies across many video frames. In addition, a detailed analysis of mistakes and advantages of the backbone model is provided, demonstrating its high ability of generalization. Our results show that the backbone model has achieved the accuracy of 66.4 % on the AffectNet dataset, outperforming all the state-of-the-art results. Moreover, the CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated a decent efficacy on dynamic visual datasets during cross-corpus experiments, achieving comparable with state-of-the-art results. In addition, we provide backbone and CNN-LSTM models for future researchers: they can be accessed via GitHub.}
