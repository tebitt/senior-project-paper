Overall, the project progress has taken the correct trajectory ever since the project proposal was submitted. The deliverables from September, including project scoping and specifications for the project have all been completed. The deliverables for October, on the other hand, have been almost completed, but have not been refined to perfection as expected. However, a working prototype for both facial expression recognition and speech emotion recognition are now available, but room for improvement still exists. Lastly, the UX design in Fusion360 is almost half done, expecting a finish within early November.
