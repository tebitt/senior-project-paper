\section{Introduction}
This progress report provides an update on the development of Pookie, an AI-driven robot designed to promote mental well-being, developed in assistance from Chula Student Wellness. Pookie aims to act as a companion to help alleviate feelings of stress and anxiety, especially in response to future societal concerns like "Terror Outbursts," an anxiety-driven phenomenon anticipated to affect Thailand. The project focuses on enhancing positivity and emotional attachment by creating a robot that interacts with users in an empathetic and calming manner.
